# cleartone

A hearing amplification application for Android devices.

## Description

`cleartone` is an Android application that uses the device's microphone to capture, process, and amplify sound in real-time. The amplified audio is then played back through the user's headphones, effectively turning the smartphone into a personal hearing amplifier. This can be particularly useful in situations where conversations or environmental sounds are difficult to hear.
